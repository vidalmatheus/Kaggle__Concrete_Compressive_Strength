Abstract: Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering. The
concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and
ingredients. These ingredients include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash,
water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate.

Data Characteristics:

The actual concrete compressive strength (MPa) for a given mixture under a
specific age (days) was determined from laboratory. Data is in raw form (not scaled).

Summary Statistics:

Number of Attributes: 9
Attribute breakdown: 8 quantitative input variables, and 1 quantitative output variable

Variable Information:

Given is the variable name, variable type, the measurement unit and a brief description.
The concrete compressive strength is the regression problem. The order of this listing
corresponds to the order of numerals along the rows of the database.

Name -- Data Type -- Measurement -- Description

Cement (component 1) -- quantitative -- kg in a m3 mixture -- Input Variable
Blast Furnace Slag (component 2) -- quantitative -- kg in a m3 mixture -- Input Variable
Fly Ash (component 3) -- quantitative -- kg in a m3 mixture -- Input Variable
Water (component 4) -- quantitative -- kg in a m3 mixture -- Input Variable
Superplasticizer (component 5) -- quantitative -- kg in a m3 mixture -- Input Variable
Coarse Aggregate (component 6) -- quantitative -- kg in a m3 mixture -- Input Variable
Fine Aggregate (component 7) -- quantitative -- kg in a m3 mixture -- Input Variable
Age -- quantitative -- Day (1~365) -- Input Variable

Concrete compressive strength -- quantitative -- MPa -- Output Variable
